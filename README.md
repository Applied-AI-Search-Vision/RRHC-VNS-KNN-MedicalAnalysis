# RRHC-VNS-KNN-MedicalAnalysis
Optimization of a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier on a medical dataset using Random Restart Hill Climbing (RRHC) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) techniques.
This repository contains Python code related to applying optimization techniques on a medical dataset using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The two main optimization techniques used are:

Random Restart Hill Climbing (RRHC)
Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)

files in the Repository:
Stellan_Lange_Assignment3_RRHC_Code.py:

This file contains the implementation of the RRHC optimization technique applied to the medical dataset.
Uses the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to evaluate the fitness of various solutions.
Data is loaded from "Assignment 3 medical_dataset.data".
Stellan_Lange_Assignment3_VNS_Code.py:

This file contains the implementation of the VNS optimization technique applied to the same medical dataset.
Similar to the RRHC implementation, it uses the KNN classifier for fitness evaluations.
